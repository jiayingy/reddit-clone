## Codes
This project is created using VueJS boilerplate. 

All `Vue` components under `src` are written by me. 

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

## Structure

This reddit clone consists of only 3 main tabs:

#### Popular:
Lists top 20 titles according to votes in descending order

#### New
Lists last 10 newly added titles from newest to oldest <br/>
_to ensure that new titles will be seen by users_

#### All
Lists all titles <br/>
_all titles are listed at once as pagination is not implemented_
